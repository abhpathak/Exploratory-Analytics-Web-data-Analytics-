# Exploratory-Analytics-Web-data-Analytics-

In this analyses, I have used R code to analyze Signups and Visits data on a companies website. 
I have explored user characteristics and answered questions like:
1. How many user never visit the website within 16 weeks of signing up?
2. How does user engagement change based on the login type (facebook login, mail login etc)
